    <p>A <strong>Castle</strong> is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages by predominantly the
        nobility or royalty and by military orders. Scholars debate the scope of the word castle, but usually consider
        it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a palace, which is not
        fortified; from a fortress, which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility; and from a fortified
        settlement, which was a public defence – though there are many similarities among these types of construction.
        Usage of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country
        houses. Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many
        different features, although some, such as curtain walls and arrowslits, were commonplace.</p>

    <p>European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries, after the fall of the Carolingian Empire
        resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes. These nobles built castles to
        control the area immediately surrounding them and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures; they
        provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offered protection from enemies. Although their
        military origins are often emphasised in castle studies, the structures also served as centres of administration
        and symbols of power. Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes, and
        rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community, such as mills,
        fertile land, or a water source.</p>
